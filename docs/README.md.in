# SAGE: *Super Advanced Game Engine*

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/KotzaBoss/sage.git
cd sage
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -- sage
./build/bin/sage
```
To customize the build see [[README#Build]].

Once you have a successful build you can begin reading [[bin/main.cpp]] and the tests to get a feel for the project.

## Development

> [!TIP] When in doubt...
> `cmake --build build -- usage`

A big part of SAGE is automated. Once you are done tweaking/extending/refactoring, make sure you _configure_ cmake at least once to generate docs.

### Build
```
cmake -B build	\
      -G Ninja	\
      -D CMAKE_LINKER=mold
cmake --build build
./build/bin/sage
```
