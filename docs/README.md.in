# SAGE: *Super Advanced Game Engine*

> [!TIP] When in doubt...
> `cmake --build build -- usage`

## Getting Started
```
cmake -B build
```
To customize the build see [[README#Build]].

Once you have a successful build you can begin reading [[bin/main.cpp]] and the tests to get a feel of the project.

## Development
A big part of SAGE is automated. Once you are done tweaking/extending/refactoring, make sure you run cmake at least once to generate docs.

### Build
```
cmake -B build	\
      -G Ninja	\
      -D CMAKE_LINKER=mold
```
